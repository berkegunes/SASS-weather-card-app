Project Overview: Weather Card UI
This project presents a responsive weather card UI, showing current weather, location, and a 4-day forecast.

Tools & Technologies Used
HTML: Structured the card with sections for current weather and forecast.

SCSS (compiled to CSS):

Modular SCSS architecture: \_variables.scss, \_mixins.scss, \_common.scss, \_weather-card.scss.

Compiled into style.css using a SCSS compiler with a style.css.map for debugging.

FontAwesome: Used for weather icons like sun, cloud, and rain.

Google Fonts: Poppins for clean typography.

SCSS Development Strategy
Variables: Defined common values like colors, spacing, and font settings.

Mixins: Used for reusable style patterns like flexbox and border-radius.

Common Styles: Applied base styles to body, headings, and reusable components (e.g., buttons).

Component SCSS (\_weather-card.scss):

Separated left-panel (location, temperature, weather type) and right-panel (status and daily forecast).

Used nested SCSS and BEM-like structure for clear maintainability.

Final Styling Features
Flexbox layout: Responsive and space-efficient.

Gradient buttons, rounded borders, and hover effects.

Background image overlay for the left panel.

Visual indicators for the current day (.active class).
